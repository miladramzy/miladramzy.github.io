  title={A Data-driven Multi-fidelity Physics-informed Learning Framework for Smart Manufacturing: A Composites Processing Case Study},
  author={Milad Ramezankhani and Amir Nazemi and Apurva Narayan and Heinz Voggenreiter and Mehrtash Harandi and Rudolf Seethaler and Abbas S. Milani},
  abstract={Despite the successful implementations of physics-informed neural networks in different scientific domains, it has been shown that for complex nonlinear systems, achieving an accurate model requires extensive hyperparameter tuning, network architecture design, and costly and exhaustive training processes. To avoid such obstacles and make the training of physics-informed models less precarious, in this paper, a data-driven multi-fidelity physics-informed framework is proposed based on transfer learning principles. The framework incorporates the knowledge from low-fidelity auxiliary systems and limited labeled data from target actual system to significantly improve the performance of conventional physics-informed models. While minimizing the efforts of designing a complex task-specific network for the problem at hand, the proposed settings guide the physics-informed model towards a fast and efficient convergence to a global optimum. An adaptive weighting method is utilized to further enhance the optimization of the model composite loss function during the training process. A data-driven strategy is also introduced for maintaining high performance in subdomains with significant divergence between low- and high-fidelity behaviours. The heat transfer of composite materials undergoing a cure cycle is investigated as a case study to demonstrate the proposed framework's performance compared to conventional physics-informed models.},

  title={An Active Transfer Learning (ATL) Framework for Smart Manufacturing with Limited Data: Case Study on Material Transfer in Composites Processing},
  author={Ramezankhani, M., Narayan, A., Seethaler, R., & Milani, A. S},
  abstract={Unprecedented advances in Machine Learning (ML), cloud computing and sensory technology promise to enable the manufacturing industry to respond rapidly to changes in marked needs while maintaining product quality and minimizing costs. Despite the unparalleled advantages that ML offers, critical limiting factors have prevented the exhaustive cultivation of ML in advanced manufacturing. Constant shifts in the process configuration and lack of sufficient fully-descriptive data restrict the performance of predictive ML models. This paper proposes to partly address these shortfalls with an active transfer learning (ATL) model that is applied to an aerospace composites manufacturing case study. The proposed ATL framework requires 1) developing an AI-based optimal experimental design using Active Learning (AL) to maximize the information gain from the limited number of allowable manufacturing trials, and 2) equipping the manufacturing process with a robust Transfer Learning (TL) model that is trained on limited available data and is immune to shifts in the process settings. The results suggest that uncertainty-based AL approaches can significantly decrease the dependency on large datasets for obtaining accurate process models. Furthermore, in comparison with traditional TL approaches, the proposed framework represents a practical solution to further reduce the necessity for generating expensive data in advanced manufacturing applications for developing reliable and transferable predictive models.},

  title={Making costly manufacturing smart with transfer learning under limited data: A case study on composites autoclave processing},
  author={Ramezankhani, M., Narayan, A., Seethaler, R., & Milani, A. S},
  abstract={The integration of advanced manufacturing processes with ground-breaking Artificial Intelligence methods continue to provide unprecedented opportunities towards modern cyber-physical manufacturing processes, known as smart manufacturing or Industry 4.0. However, the “smartness” level of such approaches closely depends on the degree to which the implemented predictive models can handle uncertainties and production data shifts in the factory over time. In the case of change in a manufacturing process configuration with no sufficient new data, conventional Machine Learning (ML) models often tend to perform poorly. In this article, a transfer learning (TL) framework is proposed to tackle the aforementioned issue in modeling smart manufacturing. Namely, the proposed TL framework is able to adapt to probable shifts in the production process design and deliver accurate predictions without the need to re-train the model. Armed with sequential unfreezing and early stopping methods, the model demonstrated the ability to avoid catastrophic forgetting in the presence of severely limited data. Through the exemplified industry-focused case study on autoclave composite processing, the model yielded a drastic (88%) improvement in the generalization accuracy compared to the conventional learning, while reducing the computational and temporal cost by 56%.},

  abstract={There are several methods (e.g., enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and liquid chromatography mass spectroscopy) that already use human plasma to detect a variety of possible diseases. However, this paper introduces the capabilities of magnetic levitation (Maglev) to detect disease (Opioid Use Disorder, used here as a model disease) by using levitation of human plasma proteins. The presented proof-of-concept findings revealed that the optical images of magnetically levitated plasma proteins carry important information about the health spectrum of plasma donors. In addition, the liquid chromatography mass spectroscopy analysis of the magnetically levitated plasma proteins demonstrated remarkable differences between the plasma of healthy individuals and patients with opioid use disorders. Overall, the presented method provides diagnostic value for disease detection using optical images of evolving magnetically levitated plasma proteins and/or proteomic information.},

  abstract={Fundamental restoration ecology and community ecology theories can help us better understand the underlying mechanisms of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) and to better design future microbial therapeutics for recurrent Clostridioides difficile infections (rCDI) and other dysbiosis-related conditions. In this study, stool samples were collected from donors and rCDI patients one week prior to FMT (pre-FMT), as well as from patients one week following FMT (post-FMT). Using metagenomic sequencing and machine learning, our results suggested that FMT outcome is not only dependent on the ecological structure of the recipients, but also the interactions between the donor and recipient microbiomes at the taxonomical and functional levels. We observed that the presence of specific bacteria in donors (Clostridioides spp., Desulfovibrio spp., Odoribacter spp. and Oscillibacter spp.) and the absence of fungi (Yarrowia spp.) and bacteria (Wigglesworthia spp.) in recipients prior to FMT could predict FMT success. Our results also suggested a series of interlocked mechanisms for FMT success, including the repair of the disturbed gut ecosystem by transient colonization of nexus species followed by secondary succession of bile acid metabolizers, sporulators, and short chain fatty acid producers.},

  title={A multi-objective Gaussian process approach for optimization and prediction of carbonization process in carbon fiber production under uncertainty},
  author={Ramezankhani, Milad and Crawford, Bryn and Khayyam, Hamid and Naebe, Minoo and Seethaler, Rudolf and Milani, Abbas S},
  abstract={During composite fiber production, carbon fibers are normally derived from polyacrylonitrile precursor. Carbonization, as a key step of this process, is significantly energy-consuming and costly, owing to its high temperature requirement. A cost-effective approach to optimize energy consumption during the carbonization is implementing predictive modeling techniques. In this article, a Gaussian process approach has been developed to predict the mechanical properties of carbon fibers in the presence of manufacturing uncertainties. The model is also utilized to optimize the fiber mechanical properties under a minimum energy consumption criterion and a range of process constraints. Finally, as the Young’s modulus and ultimate tensile strength of the fibers did not show an evident correlation, a multi-objective optimization approach was introduced to acquire the overall optimum condition of the process parameters. To estimate the trade-off between these material properties, the standard as well as an adaptive weighted sum method were applied. Results were summarized as design chart for potential applications by manufacturing process designers.},
