My research is focused on **data-efficient** and **uncertainty-aware** machine learning for advanced manufacturing. I develop reliable and transparent AI-assisted decision-making tools for high-risk manufacturing applications under **data paucity**. In particular, I focused on improving the generalization performance of machine learning in real-world applications with limited data, via [transfer learning](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmsy.2021.02.015), [active learning](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9468145), [physics-informed neural networks (PINNs)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9816983) and [meta-learning](https://github.com/miladramzy/SequentialMetaTransferPINNs/tree/main). 

I am currently a postdoctoral research fellow at Materials and Manufacturing Research Institute ([MMRI](https://mmri.ubc.ca/)). I completed my PhD and Master's degrees at [The University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/) in 2023 and 2017, respectively. I also worked as a data analyst at [QHR Technologies](https://qhrtechnologies.com/).
