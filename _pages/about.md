I am a PhD student in the School of Engineering at [The University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/) co-advised by Dr. Abbas Milani and Dr. Rudolf Seethaler. My PhD research focuses on developing data-efficient and reliable machine learning models for smart manufacturing. Specifically, I work on hybrid (sim-to-real) transfer learning frameworks equipped with physics-informed Bayesian neural networks to develop robust, reliable and transparent decision-making tools for the manufacturing industry under limited data.
