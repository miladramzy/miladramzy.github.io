My research is focused on **data-efficient** and **uncertainty-aware** machine learning for advanced manufacturing. I develop reliable and transparent AI-assisted decision-making tools for high-risk manufacturing applications under **data paucity**. In particular, I focused on improving the generalization performance of machine learning in real-world applications with limited data, via [transfer learning](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmsy.2021.02.015), [active learning](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9468145), [physics-informed neural networks (PINNs)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9816983) and meta-learning. 

I am currently a PhD candidate in the CRN lab at [The University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/). Before that, I worked as a data analyst at [QHR Technologies](https://qhrtechnologies.com/). Prior to that, I completed my Masterâ€™s at UBC, where I developed a [Gaussian Processes-based prediction and optimization framework](https://doi.org/10.1007/s42114-019-00107-6) for carbon fiber production applications.
